	///////////////////
	// Cavities data //
	///////////////////

Note 1:	Separate cavities are defined by space accessible to the core of the small probe.
	Two cavities can be in contact but if a probe cannot pass from one to the other, they are considered separated.
Note 2:	Cavities are listed in decreasing order of volume and cavity surface map file names match the IDs.
Note 3:	In single probe mode, pockets and tunnels are counted in the 'outside space'.
Note 4:	Some very small isolated chunks of small probe cores can be detected and lead to small cavities.
Note 5:	Probe occupied volume corresponds to empty space as defined by the molecular surface (similar to the Connolly surface).
	This occupied volume is typically the volume reported for cavities in cage compounds.
Note 6:	Probe accessible volume corresponds to empty space as defined
	by the surface accessible to its core (similar to the Lee-Richards surface).
Note 7:	For a detailed shape of each cavity, check the surface maps.

	/////////////////////////////
	// Surface map information //
	/////////////////////////////

The surface map files generated (.dx, OpenDX format) can be opened with
PyMOL, USCF Chimera or USCF ChimeraX.

Use the following isosurface levels to visualize the desired surface:
Level 0.5 : Van der Waals surface
Level 2.0 : Molecular and cavity surface (probe excluded, similar to the Connolly surface)
Level 5.0 : Probe accessible surface (similar to the Lee-Richards molecular surface)

For help on how to vizualize maps check the user manual or:
 - in PyMOL, simply open the map file then click 'A' in the right panel, choose mesh or surface and select the level.
   For more information, check https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Isomesh and https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Isosurface 
 - in USCF Chimera, check https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/volumeviewer.html 
 - in USCF ChimeraX, check https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/tools/volumeviewer.html 

If you wish to visualize the structure file in PyMOL with the same element radii as in the MoloVol calculation,
paste the following command lines (all at once) in the command prompt of PyMOL after opening the structure file.
Note: remove charges from ions before copying the command because only alphabetic characters are used for element symbols in PyMOL.
If an element is present in more than one oxidation state, it is necessary to select atoms separately in PyMOL to apply different radii
